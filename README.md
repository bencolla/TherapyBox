External libraries used:

- Dropzone to give a punch to drag&drop zone http://www.dropzonejs.com/

# Ideas

- Social Login
- Logout
- Display user image, somewhere
- Check dashboard and internal page navigation, connecting images and tasks to a user_id
- No time to comment all the code, commented only the most complex functions


The code is not perfect but I did the best i could with the given time.
